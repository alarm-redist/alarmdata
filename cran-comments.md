# Resubmission notes

* This is a resubmission after prior rejection of version 0.2.0.
* The ALARM Project was incorrectly named as the copyright holder in the
  initial submission.  However, this is  the name of the research group that
  the authors belong to.  This has been corrected to name the authors of the
  package, rather than the group.
* The missing years in the description have been added to references take the
  form Authors (year) <link>.
