Evaluating redistricting plan requires analysts take account state’s redistricting rules particular political geography. Comparing partisan bias plan Texas bias plan New York, example, likely misleading. Comparing state’s current plan past plan also problematic demographic political changes time. Redistricting simulations generate ensemble alternative redistricting plans within given state tailored redistricting rules.
